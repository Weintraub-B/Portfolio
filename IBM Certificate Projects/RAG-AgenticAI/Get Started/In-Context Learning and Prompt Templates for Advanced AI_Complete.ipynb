      "Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure and transparent manner. It utilizes cryptographic algorithms to ensure data integrity and immutability, enabling trustless peer-to-peer interactions without the need for intermediaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simple Explanation:\n",
      "Imagine blockchain as a digital ledger that keeps track of transactions, but instead of one central authority controlling it, many computers work together to maintain the record. Each entry, or \"block,\" is linked to the previous one, forming a chain. This makes it nearly impossible to alter past entries without being detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like a Google Doc that multiple people can edit simultaneously, but with added security features. Every change is recorded and visible to everyone involved, ensuring transparency and accountability.

    "[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by language models. Built to address the challenges of working with LLMs in practical settings, LangChain provides a standardized interface for connecting models with various data sources and application environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain serves as an abstraction layer, making it easier to build complex LLM applications without handling the low-level details of model interaction. This framework has become a standard tool in the LLM ecosystem, supporting a wide range of use cases from chatbots to document analysis systems.\n",

    "[Prompt templates](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#prompt-templates) are a key concept in LangChain. They help translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. These templates can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt template acts as a reusable structure for generating prompts with dynamic values. It allows you to define a consistent format while leaving placeholders for variables that change with each use case. This approach makes prompting more systematic and maintainable, especially when working with complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern LangChain (as of 2025) offers two main approaches to working with templates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The traditional `LLMChain` approach\n",
    "- The newer LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) pattern using the pipe operator `|` for more flexible composition\n",
    "\n",
    "LCEL has become the recommended pattern for building LangChain applications as it offers better composability, clearer visualization of data flow, and more flexibility when constructing complex chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To use a prompt template with LCEL, you typically follow these steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define your template with variables in curly braces `{}`\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this lab on prompt engineering and LangChain prompt templates! You've successfully navigated from basic prompting techniques to more advanced approaches including zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot learning, as well as chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency prompting. You then applied these concepts practically using LangChain's prompt templates with the modern LCEL pattern to create various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "By learning how to properly structure prompts and build composable chains with the pipe operator (`|`), you've gained essential skills for developing robust LLM applications. These techniques provide a solid foundation for creating more complex systems and getting the most out of any language model you work with.\n"

# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Projects

This directory contains selected final projects and outputs from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, hosted on Coursera. The work presented here represents key milestones across the learning path, with a focus on hands-on application of data science techniques using Python and common libraries.

## Overview

Each project reflects a culmination of the material covered in a course module and includes:
- Python-based Jupyter Notebooks
- Visual outputs and plots (as image files)
- Exploratory data analysis, visualization, and model building

These artifacts are included for transparency and to showcase practical data science workflows as practiced during the certification program.

## Highlights

- **Data Cleaning & Wrangling:** Handling missing data, type conversion, and normalization
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing patterns, distributions, and correlations
- **Visualization Tools:** Line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- **Modeling:** Supervised learning with scikit-learn, logistic regression, decision trees, etc.
- **Notebook Practices:** Clear documentation, in-line commentary, and reproducible code

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
